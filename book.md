# Work Log

## 2025-11-07
- Created initial README project plan from CV insights.
- Initialized local git repo and pushed README to GitHub (`mohamed2003fh/personal-website`).
- Added this `book.md` log to track ongoing implementation tasks step-by-step and will update it after every task.
- Scaffolded a React 19 + TypeScript app with Vite, installed Tailwind CSS, routing, animation, and 3D dependencies, and copied the CV asset into `public/assets/cv`.
- Established the base design system primitives (Tailwind config, fonts, global styles), reusable UI components, and the first Hero section with an interactive Three.js point field plus placeholder sections.
- Verified the setup with `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript and the bundler succeed.
- Documented local development instructions and project layout inside `README.md` so future work has a clear starting point.
- Added structured data modules (about, contact, experience, projects) to power the upcoming sections.
- Implemented About and Experience sections leveraging the new data, including stat cards and a vertical impact timeline, and verified via `npm run build`.
- Shipped Projects and Contact sections with data-driven cards, social CTAs, and a mailto-backed form, then documented the contact behavior in the README.
- Added the provided portrait to `public/assets/images/profile.jpg` and layered it into the hero card alongside the Three.js point field.
- Created data + UI for the Skills/Services grid and Education timeline, updated README assets checklist, and ran `npm run build` to validate.
- Added a sticky navigation bar, skip link, smooth scrolling, and a footer with socials/resume links to complete the site framework; documented new asset paths.
- Produced branded SVG mockups for each project, updated data references, and marked project visuals complete in the README.
- Implemented an SEO metadata system (custom Meta component + JSON-LD graph) to set document titles, social previews, and structured data without external dependencies.
- Integrated Plausible analytics via a lightweight React component + noscript pixel and refreshed README next steps accordingly.
- Added a theme system (CSS variables + ThemeProvider + toggle in the navbar) so the site supports both dark and light modes with stored user preference.
- Overhauled the visual styling with glass panels, gradient tokens, and a site-wide 3D flow-field background animation for extra depth.
- Ensured the background animation mounts above the page (with reduced-motion guard) so the effect is visible throughout the site.
