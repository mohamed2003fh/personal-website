# Work Log

## 2025-11-07
- Created initial README project plan from CV insights.
- Initialized local git repo and pushed README to GitHub (`mohamed2003fh/personal-website`).
- Added this `book.md` log to track ongoing implementation tasks step-by-step and will update it after every task.
- Scaffolded a React 19 + TypeScript app with Vite, installed Tailwind CSS, routing, animation, and 3D dependencies, and copied the CV asset into `public/assets/cv`.
- Established the base design system primitives (Tailwind config, fonts, global styles), reusable UI components, and the first Hero section with an interactive Three.js point field plus placeholder sections.
- Verified the setup with `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript and the bundler succeed.
- Documented local development instructions and project layout inside `README.md` so future work has a clear starting point.
